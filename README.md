## Overview
This project creates a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The chatbot is built to recognize user intents and generate relevant responses based on predefined patterns. It leverages the `nltk` library for processing natural language, `scikit-learn` for machine learning, and `streamlit` to develop an interactive web interface.

## Features
- Recognizes different user intents, including greetings, farewells, expressions of gratitude, and more.
- Generates appropriate responses based on user input.
- Keeps track of the conversation history, allowing users to review previous interactions.
- Developed with Python, utilizing well-known libraries for NLP and machine learning.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NLTK**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Streamlit**
- **JSON** for intents data


---

## Usage
To run the chatbot application, execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the web interface. Type your message in the input box and press Enter to see the chatbot's response.

## Intents Data
The chatbot's behavior is defined by the `intents.json` file, which contains various tags, patterns, and responses. You can modify this file to add new intents or change existing ones.

---

## Conversation History
The chatbot saves the conversation history in a CSV file (`chat_log.csv`). You can view past interactions by selecting the "Conversation History" option in the sidebar.
